# ECS 261 Homework 1: Writing Specifications in Python and Z3

## Due: ~~Wednesday, January 21~~ Friday, January 23

This homework is a problem set. Please see `hw1.pdf` for further instructions.

**Note:** Q5 is now optional. Please submit at least Q1-4.

To submit the homework, you will upload your solutions as a PDF (`hw1.pdf`) and accompanying code (`hw1.py` plus any corresponding helper files) to Gradescope.

## Grading notes

Solutions must be typed. We recommend you write your solutions in LaTeX. You may find it convenient to edit `hw1.tex` directly; if you do so, please remove or comment out the problem statements and include only your solutions.

We won't be able to grade code that doesn't run, so please double check that your code runs before submitting. You should be able to run `pytest <yourfile>.py` and see a list of successful, skipped, and expected failing test cases. If you have some broken code, please remember to comment out the broken parts (or use `@pytest.mark.skip` to the unit tests) to ensure you receive some partial credit.
